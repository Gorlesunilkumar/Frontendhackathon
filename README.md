# Extracurricular Activities Portal (Frontend)

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold for a college extracurricular activities landing page.

Features implemented:
- Sticky navbar with section scrolling
- Hero banner with gradient background
- Clubs & Events cards
- Gallery grid using placeholder images
- Notices list
- Contact form (UI only)
- Check Participation input (UI placeholder)
- Login modal (mock) that routes to `/dashboard/admin` or `/dashboard/student`
- Basic framer-motion animations

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Front End\EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITES"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Next steps:
